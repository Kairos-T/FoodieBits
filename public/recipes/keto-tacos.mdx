## Ingredients
1. 2 cups cheddar cheese, shredded
2. 1 pound ground beef
3. 2 tablespoon taco seasoning
4. 1/2 cup water
5. Toppings of your choice (lettuce, tomato, onion, sour cream, etc.)

## Instructions
1. Start by lining a baking sheet. You can use a baking sheet with parchment paper but a silicone mat is the best because the cheese comes off easily every time.
2. Then you drop little piles of grated cheese on to the baking sheet. For cheese taco shells I suggest using about 1/4 cup of cheddar cheese per shell.
3. Place the baking sheet in the oven and bake at 350 degrees F for 5-7 minutes, or until the shredded cheese has melted and the edges begin to brown.
4. Shape your cheese taco shells. Use two glasses and sit a thick handled spoon (or whatever utensil you have) across the glasses.
5. Let the cheese cool for a minute then lift it off of the baking sheet and drape it over the spoon handle. Let it cool completely, this only takes about 5 minutes, and you have a low carb taco shell!
6. In a large skillet over medium heat brown the ground beef.
