4. Sliced serrano chilies
5. Small handful fresh cilantro, finely chopped

## Instructions
### Prep
1. Boil a pot of water, salt it, and cook the pasta according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.
2. Chop the ginger, garlic, serrano peppers, onions, and red and green bell peppers.
3. Grate the Gruyere and cheddar cheeses.

### Cook the Sauce and Pasta
1. Heat up a dutch castiron on medium heat, once hot, add oil followed by serrano peppers. Saute for 30 seconds.
2. Add garlic and ginger. Saute for another 30 seconds.
3. Add onions and season with salt. Saute for 2-3 minutes or until they're translucent.
4. Add red and green bell peppers. Saute for 2-3 minutes.
5. In the meantime, using a mortar and pestle or a coffee grinder grind your spices - cinnamon, cloves, peppercorns, cardamom, and fennel seeds.
6. Add the ground spices to the pot. Saute for 30 seconds.
7. Then add tomato paste and cook for a minute.
8. Move the onions to the side and add butter in the middle of the pan.
9. Lower the heat. Once the butter melts, add the flour.
10. Cook the flour and butter for about 1-2 minutes to form a roux. This will help thicken the sauce.
11. Add milk and whisk the sauce until it thickens. This will take about 5-7 minutes.
12. Add the grated Gruyere and cheddar cheese. Whisk until the cheese melts.
13. Add the cooked pasta to the sauce and mix well.
14. Make sure the cheese is at room temperature to avoid curdling the sauce. Add 1 ¼ cups of Gruyere cheese and 1 ¼ cups of mild cheddar cheese to the sauce. Turn off the stove when adding the cheese.
16. The sauce should now be creamy and cheesy.
17. Check on the pasta. Once cooked, drain the pasta completely.
18. Add 12 ounces of cooked pasta to the sauce.

### Assemble Pasta
1. Combine the remainder of the cheese and 1-2 tablespoon of panko crumbs.
2. Add the cheese and panko mixture to the pasta.
3. Top with sliced serrano peppers.
4. Bake in a preheated oven at 350 degrees for 30-35 minutes.
5. Garnish with fresh cilantro. Enjoy!
