# South Western Vegetarian Breakfast Skillet
The South Western Vegetarian Breakfast Skillet is a hearty and flavorful dish that’s perfect for breakfast or brunch.

## Ingredients:
- Olive oil
- Baby red potatoes
- Green bell pepper
- Onion
- Salt & pepper
- Tomato
- Salsa
- Pinto beans
- Cheddar jack cheese
- Chili Powder
- Eggs
- Cilantro (optional)
- Avocado (optional)
- Hot sauce (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
2. Add potatoes, bell pepper, onion, salt, and pepper. Let cook, stirring frequently, until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes.
3. Add the chili powder and stir to combine.
4. Add tomato, salsa, and pinto beans, and let cook, stirring occasionally, until warmed through, about 5 minutes.
5. Top with cheese and let rest a few minutes until melted.
6. Meanwhile, heat ½ tablespoon olive oil in a small skillet over medium low heat. Once hot, cook the eggs one or two at a time. For sunny side up eggs, cover the pan with a lid and let cook on one side until the whites are solid but the yolk is still jiggly, about 2-3 minutes.
7. Remove the eggs from the skillet, season with salt and pepper, and repeat with the remaining eggs.
8. Serve the breakfast skillet topped with fried eggs, sliced avocado, a sprinkle of cilantro, and a dash of hot sauce or salsa.
