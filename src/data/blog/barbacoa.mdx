# Barbacoa Recipe

Barbacoa is a traditional Mexican dish that consists of slow-cooked meat, often beef, goat, or lamb, seasoned with lots of spices, aromatic herbs, and chiles to create the ultimate flavorful melt-in-your-mouth meat[^1^][1][^2^][2].

## Ingredients:
- 3 pounds beef chuck roast (fat trimmed), cut into 2-inch chunks
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 chipotles in adobo sauce, chopped
- 1 (4-ounce) can diced green chiles
- 1 small white onion, finely chopped
- 1/4 cup fresh lime juice
- 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
- 3 bay leaves
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 1 tablespoon dried Mexican oregano (or standard dried oregano)
- 2 teaspoons fine sea salt
- 1 teaspoon freshly-ground black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/2 cup beef stock or water

## Instructions:
1. Cut the beef into large 4-inch chunks and season them generously with kosher salt and ground black pepper on all sides.
2. Heat 1 Â½ tablespoons of oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add 3 or 4 pieces of meat and brown it on all sides. When browned, transfer to a plate and set aside. Continue working in batches until all the meat is browned.
3. In the same skillet, place onions and the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring often, making sure to scrape up any brown bits on the bottom of the pan. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute, until fragrant.
4. Add the beer, apple cider vinegar, lime juice, chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, all the spices, and bay leaves. Stir together to combine and remove it from the heat.
5. Add the seared meat into a large slow cooker and pour the liquid mixture on top. Cover and cook on low for 6-8 hours, or on high for 3-4 hours, or until the beef is tender and falls apart easily when shredded with a fork.
6. Using two forks, shred the beef into bite-sized pieces inside of the slow cooker.
