# Traditional Italian Spaghetti Carbonara
Spaghetti Carbonara, one of the most famous Pasta Recipes of Roman Cuisine, is made only with 5 simple ingredients: spaghetti seasoned with browned guanciale, black pepper, pecorino Romano and beaten eggs.

In the authentic Italian recipe for carbonara, the ingredients are very few and of excellent quality. The high quality of ingredients is a necessary condition for the success of this recipe.

In spite of many beliefs, the ingredients of the traditional recipe are only 5: guanciale, pecorino Romano, eggs, pepper and spaghetti.

## Ingredients:
- 350 grams of Spaghetti
- 200 grams of Guanciale
- 4 Whole Medium Eggs
- 100 grams of grated Pecorino Romano Cheese
- Ground Black Pepper to taste

## Instructions:
1. Boil water for the pasta. Use 1 liter of water for every 100 grams of pasta and 10 grams of coarse salt per liter of water.
2. Cut the guanciale into small pieces and cook in a skillet over medium heat for about 2 to 3 minutes. Stir occasionally so that it cooks evenly. Once ready, turn off the heat, cover with a lid and set aside.
3. In a bowl, combine the eggs and pecorino Romano cheese.
4. Once the pasta is cooked, drain it and add it to the skillet with the guanciale. Mix well.
5. Remove the skillet from the heat and quickly add the egg and cheese mixture. Stir quickly to create a creamy sauce with the heat of the pasta. Make sure the eggs do not cook so much to look like scrambled eggs or too little to be raw and cold.
6. Season with ground black pepper and serve immediately.
